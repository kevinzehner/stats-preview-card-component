## Overview

practice front-end mentor project of a card component with an image on one side content on the other

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3

### What I learned
This project gave me a chance to further practice css. one of the new properties I learned during this project was the background-image property, which i had not used before. I struggled with making the web page mobile friendly, the image seems to disappear when the screen size is reduced. 

### Continued development
I'd like to build some more knowledge with media queries as it is one of my lacking areas. Any feedback would be appreciated
