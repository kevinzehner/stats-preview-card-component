## Overview

This website was a practice project, which was the final part of a Udemy HTML/CSS course. The project is a made up food delivery website, built with a variety of different CSS components and fully responsive. There is some Javascript applied to enable the smooth scrolling and sticky navigation bar.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS3
  -Javascript

### What I learned

This project was a very good introduction to web development for me. Some things which i found particularly useful was the creation of layouts using both CSS-grid and flexbox and how to plan a real world project. The tutorial also provided solid advice and useful CSS properties to style different components and elements of a website.

### Continued development

My aim now is to continue expanding my HTML and CSS knowledge by creating my own websites and practice projects. CSS-grid in particular is an area where i would like to improve on. Once i am comfortable with creating responsive layouts independently and solidified by knowledge on different CSS properties my goal is to pick up a CSS framework and also learn more Javascript.
